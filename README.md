# HomeStatusDisplay
#### original code forked from https://github.com/tobiasfaust/HomeStatusDisplay


**This fork refactures the original code and improved some technicals**

One change is that I add two push buttons and a realais to mute the door bell.


Show status information sent via MQTT (e.g. from ioBroker, Home Assistant or any other MQTT-speaking system) using RGB LEDs.

## Requirements
### Hardware
This code was tested on a Wemos D1 mini ESP8266. It *should* run on any ESP8266 and with some changes in the "HSD_Switch.h" file at the line 7,8, and 9 and in the "HSD_Input.h" file at the line 5 (with the right pin definition of the ESP32 board) also on ESP32 boards. You need a number of WS2812B LEDs (e.g. a NeoPixel stripe) connected to `5V`, `GND` and a `DATA` pin of the ESP. Please notice the wiring tips from Adafruit- use a large capacitor (around 1000uF) between the `5V` and `GND` of the LEDs and put a 300-500 Ohm resistor into the `DATA` line connection to the LEDs. Here is a overview of the wiring - it is the standard wiring recommended for WS2812B stripes. The board can be powered via a the 5V power supply via the USB port. Of course it should be powerful enough to drive all the LEDs used:

### Software
The code was developed using PlatformIO. You dont need to compile it by yourself, please us the [web-installer](https://tobiasfaust.github.io/HomeStatusDisplay/)

You also need a running MQTT broker (e.g. https://mosquitto.org), to which the system you want to monitor (e.g. FHEM) pushes its status information. You can also use a public accessible MQTT-Broker, but its not recommend due security reasons. For example, in FHEM the status information which you want to display, can be configured using the FHEM modules `MQTT` and `MQTT_BRIDGE`.

## How to us
### Please use the [web-installer](https://viper-666.github.io) to upload the firmware. After it you will request entering Wifi Credentials. After sucessfully WiFiConnect, the installer tells you the Device-IP.

Now, your HomeStatusDisplay is ready to use.
Upon first usage, you should configure your Device at some configuration pages to set up:
 - MQTT setup
 - LED setup

## User is "admin" and password is also "admin". Please change this at the "General" side.
